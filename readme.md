I am sensei wise, i have been trying to learn javascript, css, html and python the past few months. I have mastered basic javascript which has given me the ability to
create discord bots and help others. 

My personal portfolio is made with javascript and hosted on https://www.vercel.com


You can take a look at my projects and feel free to use them

Bye
